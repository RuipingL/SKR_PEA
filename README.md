#Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation of Road-driving Scenes[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13393)
##Structure:SKR+PEA
##Introduction
We propose SKR+PEA framework to distill the knowledge from feature maps and patch embeddings of vision transformers.
##Usage
the code will be uploaded soon.
